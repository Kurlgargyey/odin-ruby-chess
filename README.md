# odin-ruby-chess

This is a program which lets you play chess against a human opponent. It was made for the Odin Project online course.

## How to use:
Run the driver.rb file in the main directory, and the game will start. If you have previously played, then a save file will have been created and you will be given the option of loading it.

The game ends when there is a checkmate or when there is a draw due to the rules of the game. You can quit the game by closing the terminal.
